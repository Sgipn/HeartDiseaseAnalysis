Hypotheses: \
$H_0$: There is no association between the two variables. \
$H_a$: There is an association between the two variables.

### High blood pressure

Pearson $\chi^2$ test can be used if there are more observations (e.g. lager than 10) for individual cells. Also since it is 2X2 table, we can use Fisher’s exact test to compare both p-value

The resulting p-value obtained from the Pearson $\chi^2$ and Fisher’s exact test are very small, which means that there is stronger evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis. 

From the odd ratio obtained from the sample, it shows that people who have high blood pressure are more likely (4.592099 times) to have heart disease than people who do not have high blood pressure. In addition, since the odd ratio is not equal to 1, it means that two variables are not independent, which is same as the results obtained by Pearson Test and Fisher’s Exact Test.
```{r,echo = FALSE}
#contingency table (HighBP vs Heart Disease)
counthp=table(HighBP=heart$HighBP,HeartDis=heart$HeartDiseaseorAttack)
counthp

#pearson test 
pearsonStatistic_hp <- chisq.test(counthp, correct=FALSE)$stat
pearsonpVal_hp <- chisq.test(counthp, correct=FALSE)$p.val

#fisher exact test

#odd ratio
odd_hp=(138886*17928)/(5965*90901)
```

### High cholesterol

The resulting p-value obtained from the Pearson $\chi^2$ and Fisher’s exact test are very small, which means that there is stronger evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis.

From the odd ratio obtained from the sample, it shows that people who have high cholesterol are more likely (3.589073 times) to have heart disease than people who do not have high cholesterol. In addition, since the odd ratio is not equal to 1, it means that two variables are not independent, which is same as the results obtained by Pearson Test and Fisher’s Exact Test.

```{r,echo = FALSE}

From above different age groups odd ratio, it is found that the odd ratio increases as age increases. Interestingly, it is also found that the odd ratio becomes larger than 1 after the age group 8. Therefore, people with the age over 60 will have higher chances to get the heart disease, especially those people who are over 80. On the other hands, the odd ratio tends to close to zero as age decreases. Therefore, the young people have less chances to get the heart disease.

### Conclusion:

![Page1](/Users/chang/Downloads/table.jpg)
From the table above, it shows that Stroke has the highest odd ratio,
which is 6.936. This means that people who have stroke have the highest chance to get heart disease than people with other factors since the highest odd ratio is obtained in this group. In addition, the second high odd ratio occurs on the HighBP variable, which is 4.5921. Therefore, the people who have high blood pressure are more likely to get heart disease than others. 

Since p-values are too small to show in the R, test statistics will be used to compare the test result. The test result shows that Age and Diff walk variables have the
largest test statistics. Therefore, there is a strong evidence to conclude that these two variables are not independent from heart disease. They are strong associated with heart disease.
