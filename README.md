Midterm project for STA160 at UC Davis

EDA:
- Summary statistics (count, mean, sd, min, quartiles, max)
- Histogram (frequency of each variable value)
- Correlation heatmap

Research Question(s):
- 

Analysis:
- Independence test 
   -  parametric chi-sq test for independence 
   -  nonparametric permutation test 
- K-sample test (does level i of variable X have a significant effect on heart-disease?)
   - ANOVA (parametric)
   - Kruskal-Wallis Test

ML: (binary classifiers since heart-disease is a categorical {1,0} )
- SVM
- Naive Bayes
- kNN
- k-means clustering
